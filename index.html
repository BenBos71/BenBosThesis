    Sentiment and Emotion Analysis</p>

    <p>You are invited to participate in a research study of Sentiment and Emotion Analysis. You were selected as a possible subject because you are 18 years or older. We ask that you read this form and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to be in the study.</p>

    <p>The study is being conducted by Ben Bos, a student in the Masters of Computer Science program, and Dr. Robert Ball, who is the graduate director of the Masters of Computer Science program.</p>

    <p><strong>PROCEDURES FOR THE STUDY:</strong></p>

    <p>If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things:</p>
    <p>First you will fill out a demographics form with your age, your sex, your level of education, and (if applicable) your field of study. After that you will begin a survey where you will read a sentence and select from a dropdown menu if the sentence you read makes you feel enjoyment, sadness, anger, contempt, disgust, fear, or surprise. You will also select whether you felt the sentence was positive or negative. You will do this a total of 35 times.</p>
